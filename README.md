# Just Tech News

## Description

Just Tech News is a website that allows web developers to login or sign up to post links to share with other developers. Users edit their own posts, comment on each other's posts as well as vote on them.

## User Story

As a web developer, I want a fourm where I can post helpful links for my developer community and see the posts of others. I want to be able to edit my posts if need be and I want to comment on others' posts as well as vote on them.

## Acceptance Criteria

When I go to the forum homepage I am presented with the ability to login if I already have an account or signup if I do not yet have an account. That kicks off my session on the website which starts with a dashboard view where I can post clickable links and view my previously created entires. From this dashboard I can also edit my posts.

When I click on the homepage view I can see all of the Just Tech News posts. When I click on the post of another I can comment or vote on it. When I am finished with my session I have the option to log out.
